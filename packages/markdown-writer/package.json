Default is `_draft/`.\n- **sitePostsDir**: The directory of posts from the root of `siteLocalDir`. Default is `_posts/{year}`. You can also use `{year}`, `{month}` and `{day}`.\n- **urlForTags**: The URL to tags `JSON` file. Refer to next section.\n- **urlForPosts**: The URL to posts `JSON` file.

Upload the generated `JSON` files to website and update the settings.\n\n### TODOs\n\n- Insert image\n- Insert table\n- Insert footnote\n- Support multiple blog directories\n\nView [CHANGELOG :notebook_with_decorative_cover:](https://github.com/zhuochun/md-writer/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).\n\nIf you found any bug, please submit an issue [here :octocat:](https://github.com/zhuochun/md-writer/issues).\n\nLicense in [MIT :unlock:](https://github.com/zhuochun/md-writer/blob/master/LICENSE.md).\n\n## Tips\n\n- Jumping among your posts: `Cmd-t` or `Cmd-p`.\n- Markdown Preview: [markdown-preview](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-preview) package.\n",
