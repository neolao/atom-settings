You can now also underline the the current lines thanks to
[@sniperbat](https://github.com/sniperbat). This isn't enabled by default, and
you can edit the colour and type of line.

When selecting more than one line of text, you can enable selection borders at
the top and bottom of the selections. This isn't enabled by default.
