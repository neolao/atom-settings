# php-integrator-navigation

This package provides code navigation for your PHP source code using [PHP Integrator](https://github.com/Gert-dev/php-integrator-base).

**Note that the [php-integrator-base](https://github.com/Gert-dev/php-integrator-base) package is required and needs to be set up correctly for this package to function correctly.**

What is included?
  * Navigate to the definition of your global PHP constnats and functions.
  * Navigate to the definition of classes, traits and interfaces by alt-clicking them.
  * Navigate to the definition of class, trait and interface members by alt-clicking them.

Tip: You can also alt-click the names of classes, interfaces and traits inside docblocks! If an item is *navigable*, it will be underlined when moving your mouse over it while holding the alt modifier key.

Regarding donations: they were not my primary intention when releasing this project as open source, but I do accept them and am very grateful for any donation you may give. A link is provided on the readme of the [php-integrator-base](https://github.com/Gert-dev/php-integrator-base) package.
